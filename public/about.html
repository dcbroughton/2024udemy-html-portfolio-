<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welp, what's there to share?! I currently work as a solutions consultant for a public traded company and it's a pretty rad job.
  Additionally, I love API stuff. Troubleshooting, testing, resolving user issues related to API is my favorite.
  Pairing this with the desire to actually learn how to build APIs and learn more about software engineering led me to this full stack Udemy course by <a href="https://www.appbrewery.com">App Brewery</a>.

<p>So here's my first site with a few pages to click on. Hope you enjoy!</p>
